🔹 What is the OSI Model?

The OSI Model is a 7-layer reference model that explains how data travels from one computer to another over a network.

👉 Developed by ISO
👉 Used for learning, designing, and troubleshooting networks

🔹 Why OSI Model is Important?

Standardizes networking concepts

Helps understand where a problem occurs

Makes learning networking easy & structured

🔹 Layer-by-Layer Explanation
🟢 Layer 7: Application Layer
🔸 What it does:

Provides network services to user applications

Closest to the user

🔸 Examples:

Web browser

Email

File transfer

🔸 Protocols:

HTTP / HTTPS

FTP

SMTP

DNS

🔸 Example:

👉 You type google.com in browser

🟢 Layer 6: Presentation Layer
🔸 What it does:

Data formatting

Encryption / Decryption

Compression

🔸 Example:

SSL / TLS encryption

Converting data formats (JSON, XML)

👉 Makes sure data is readable by receiver

🟢 Layer 5: Session Layer
🔸 What it does:

Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions

Keeps connection alive

🔸 Example:

Login session

Video call session

👉 Handles session control

🟢 Layer 4: Transport Layer (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)
🔸 What it does:

End-to-end communication

Data segmentation

Flow control

Error control

🔸 Protocols:

TCP (Reliable)

UDP (Fast, unreliable)

🔸 Example:

TCP → Web browsing

UDP → Video streaming

👉 Ensures data reaches correctly

🟢 Layer 3: Network Layer
🔸 What it does:

Routing

Logical addressing

🔸 Protocols:

IP (IPv4, IPv6)

ICMP

Routing protocols

🔸 Devices:

Router

👉 Decides best path for data

🟢 Layer 2: Data Link Layer
🔸 What it does:

Physical addressing (MAC address)

Error detection

Frame formation

🔸 Devices:

Switch

Bridge

🔸 Example:

Ethernet

ARP

👉 Responsible for node-to-node delivery

🟢 Layer 1: Physical Layer
🔸 What it does:

Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s)

Defines cables, voltages, connectors

🔸 Devices:

Cables

Hub

NIC

👉 Actual hardware transmission

🔹 Data Flow Example (Simple)

👉 You open a website:

1️⃣ Application → HTTP request
2️⃣ Presentation → Encrypt data
3️⃣ Session → Maintain session
4️⃣ Transport → TCP segments
5️⃣ Network → IP routing
6️⃣ Data Link → Frames + MAC
7️⃣ Physical → Bits over cable

🔹 OSI vs TCP/IP (Interview Favorite)
OSI	TCP/IP
7 layers	4 layers
Theoretical	Practical
ISO model	Used in real networks
🔹 Common Interview Questions & Answers

👉 Transport Layer

❓ Router works on which layer?

👉 Layer 3 (Network)

🔹 One-Line Exam Answer 🎯

OSI model is a 7-layer reference model that explains how data is transmitted from source to destination in a network.

🔹 Real-World Tip

👉 OSI model is conceptual, but TCP/IP is practical
